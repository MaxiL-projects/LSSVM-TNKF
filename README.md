# Least Squares Support Vector Machines - Tensor Network Kalman Filter

This repository contains the code for the paper: "Tensor Network Kalman Filtering for Large-Scale LSSVMs".

There are five TNKF implementations on different datasets. 

Note: The datasets are not all my own work, please credit/cite the respective people and institutions for these!
